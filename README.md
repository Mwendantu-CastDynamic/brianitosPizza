##Known Bugs
The main project bugs relate mainly to the use of JavaScript, JQuery and configuring these to work properly with the Object properties 
and their prototypes and generate the expected output.

There were some challenges experienced particularly in configuring Bootstrap to apply the desired styling and layout to the selected elements of the webpage.

 Additional bugs also arose when applying functionality to various elements of the webpage using javascript and jquery code, which did not generate the expected output even after persistent debugging.
